 Role of AI in This Project
This project integrates AI-powered logic to enhance decision-making and provide actionable insights beyond basic calculations:

1. Smart Utilization Feedback
The system automatically analyzes volume and weight utilization and identifies the limiting factor (volume or weight).

If truck utilization is low (e.g. <70%), the app provides AI-generated suggestions to improve efficiency, such as:

Reducing or batching low-volume SKUs

Reorganizing shipments by destination

Upgrading/downgrading truck size

These suggestions are generated using a custom logic engine simulating basic AI heuristics for logistics optimization.

2. Efficiency Rating System (AI Enhancement)
The app gives a qualitative rating (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Poor) based on the calculated utilization percentages.

These labels help users quickly interpret performance without diving into raw numbers ‚Äî an intuitive, user-friendly AI enhancement.

3. Template Intelligence
Users can save SKU templates and reuse them. In future iterations, AI can analyze past templates to auto-suggest best combinations for similar destinations or volume patterns.

4. Scalable AI Vision
The architecture is designed to support more advanced AI/ML features in future, such as:

Predictive truck allocation based on SKU patterns

Route optimization using real-time data

Reinforcement learning for optimal packing strategies
